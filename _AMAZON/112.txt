Amazon Interview | Set 112 (On-Campus)

Amazon visited our campus and was hired as intern. These are the questions that I faced.

Online Round (90 minutes)
20 Basic MCQs (Data structure, C, C++, OS, Aptitude, Networks).
2 programs :
1. Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] and its permutations (or anagrams) in txt[]

E.g. : I/p : txt[] = “BACDGABCDA” pat[] = “ABCD”
o/p :0,5,6 

2. There is a matrix mat[m][n] with entries as 0 or 1 When you are at 1 you can move in all the eight directions and when at 0, you have to return back. Find the number of cluster of 1′s

e.g. input  { {1,1,0,0,0},
             {1,0,0,1,0},
             {0,0,0,1,1},
             {1,0,1,0,0}  }
output 3

clusters ((0,0),(0,1),(1,0))    
         (1,2),(2,2),(2,3),(3,2)        
         (3,0)

Round 1:
1) Introduce yourself.

2) Any moment when you worked really really hard to solve a problem.

3) Find the best fit for a packet to be fitted in a rack rack sizes are given in increasing order in other words find the ceil value of a key in sorted array.

4) Check given binary tree is BST or not

5) Find the lowest common ancestor in binary tree

6) If I have any question to ask him

Round 2:

1) Find largest sum contiguous subarray in goven array

2) If I had any question to ask him
