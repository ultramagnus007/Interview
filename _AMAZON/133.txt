Amazon interview Experience | Set 133

Recently had a interview with Amazon, through employee referral. All face to face rounds. I didn’t clear, so no offer. :(

1st Technical Round:

Given an integer, find the next biggest integer whose digits are in increasing order.

Example:
Input: 118
Output: 123

Input: 127
Output: 234

Input: 987
Output: 1234

Designing question: Design a parking space to park a car.

2nd Manager Round:

Explain my current project. Architecture and design flows etc. asked.
Any challenges while working on the project.
Any glitches/cases where you completed got it wrong etc.

After two rounds asked to leave. I guess I didn’t answer as per standards.

Thanks anyways GeeksForGeeks.
