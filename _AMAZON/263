Amazon Interview Experience | Set 263 (For SDET)

It’s an on campus recruitment. The interview process started on October, 2015.
Round 1:

It had 25 MCQ questions from core subjects of CS including Operating systems, Database, Networks, Data structures and algorithms, Fundamentals of programming. Apart from that there was 2 programming questions too. Those who solved at least 1 programming problem and few MCQ questions were selected for next round. But it’s better to solve both the programming questions. I was asked the following questions:

Round 3:

It was similar to that of round 2. I was asked the following questions:

Overall it was an awesome experience. I enjoyed the interview process.
