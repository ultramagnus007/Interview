    http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-an-array-of-0s-1s-and-2s/ in place. He asked me if i knew the question, I said yes. Then he told me to write code covering all corner cases.


3rd Round(F2F) 1hr:

    http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-a-pair-with-given-sum-in-bst/ . Asked all possible solutions and then asked to write code for it.

All the interviewers were very helpful. In all rounds for every question they were looking for what kind of approach you are going to use and proper reasoning for the same. Not just coding , neat and efficient coding was required because for each question at the end you have to code and they expect you not to miss edge cases.
