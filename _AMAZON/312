Amazon Interview Experience | Set 312 (Off Campus)

I got a call from amazon for F2F discussion for SDE1 at hyderabad. There were totally four rounds and asked to leave for the day.

First round:

    Find the kth smallest element in row wise and column wise sorted matrix. (No Heap solution)
    There is a given data with time and number of orders at that time and it will random. Then there will be a query of how many orders placed between a given interval of time.

Second Round:

    http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-number-of-swaps-required-for-arranging-pairs-adjacent-to-each-other/
    There given a list of strings out which we have to print the unique strings. Unique string is a string which is not repeated.

Third Round:

It was a discussion on my current project and the challenges I faced and how I managed when I am unable to meet the deadlines.

    There given a 2 Lists with int values. We need to find the longest chain. Eg: L1 = { 2,7,4,8,9,10}, L2 = {1,2,8,9,4}. Here the solution is 2 (chain is 2,4 or 8,9). Because 7 is present in L1 which is not L2.
    Given a equi-weighted uni directed graph and need to find the max distance possible from a given node.

Fourth Round:

It was again discussion on my current project.

Final question of my interview: Add 1 to the integer represented by a linked list with O(n) time and O(1) space.

First I start with the recursion and he suggested me without stack space too. Then I suggested for the reversing of linked list and then adding the number. He was again asked me without reversing of linked list. Then I came up with the solution with linear search.
