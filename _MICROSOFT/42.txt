Microsoft Interview Experience | Set 42 (For SDE1)

I received interview call from Microsoft (Bangalore) for CRM team, SDE1 position for 1.5 year experience.

Round 1: 1 hour

It was a GD like interview, with multiple people in same room given same question and interviewer was discussing individually with every person.
Given 2 arays if integers, sort the first array based on order of 2nd array.

I started with brute force approach, then optimized to binary seacrh and then hashmap

Round 2: 1 hour

Same as previous round, one interviewer, multiple candidates same question individual discussion.

If you have a stream of incoming characters, reverse and print the string as soon as input is finished. Write a code for same

Round 3: F2F 1 hour

One-on-one

Flatten a multi-level linked list

Took a while to solve this one.
First I used a stack and then formed an algo without stack an without recursion.

Round 4: F2F 1.5 hour

A printed sheet of a c-program was given, had to find syntactical and logical error in program.

Connect all nodes of a binary tree which are at same level.
You can not store level information

<I used a variation of level order traversal>

Round 5: Hiring Manager <1 hour

Detailed discussion on current work, was grilled a lot

Reasons to leave current company

Tips:

Keep thinking loud and discussing your thought process with interviewer. They will keep giving hints for you to reach solution.
Find a solution, any solution, and keep optimizing it.

Hope this helps. :)
