It was a hiring drive for MBS group bangalore location.. The interview process was easy and well structured. Though the questions are easy the interviewer explored all the intricacies and I had to write full code for all the cases. Taking care of corner cases and optimizing time and space complexities. Each round went for 45min to 1 hr.

My suggestion will be brush up your basics. Donâ€™t try to write down the optimized code at the very beginning. give a simple solution first and gradually optimize it.
